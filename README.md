# yet unnamed gumroad discord linked roles

need to set up a discord bot for every product because of the way the metadata is

```
#.env
  PORT="3000" # defaults 3000
  SELF_URL="" # no /, defaults to https://localhost:3000
  CLIENT_ID="" # Discord client ID
  BOT_TOKEN="" # Discord client ID
  CLIENT_SECRET="" Discord client secret
  PRODUCT_ID="" # Gumroad product ID. Shows up where you turn on license keys.
  PRODUCT_NAME="" # Name shown in Discord, "Owns [product name]". Defaults "some thing".
```
